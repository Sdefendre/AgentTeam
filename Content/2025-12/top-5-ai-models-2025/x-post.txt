The AI race hit new heights in 2025.

Here are the Top 5 models that changed the game:

1. Claude Opus 4.5 - Dominated coding benchmarks (80.9% on SWE-bench)

2. Gemini 3 Pro - Hit a historic 1501 Elo on LMArena

3. GPT-5.1 - OpenAI's most refined flagship yet

4. Grok 4 - Unbeatable for real-time data

5. LLaMA 4 Scout - 10M token context window

The shift? We're no longer asking "which AI is best"

We're asking "which AI is best for THIS task"

2025 proved: specialization wins.
